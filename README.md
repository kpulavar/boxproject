boxproject 

There are two implementations on this Git repository. The C/C++ is implements the printing of the box structure. I am still familiarizing
myself with the boost and Qt libraries, so image extraction(Bonus 2) is not yet implemented. This was tested on windows using Cygwin g++ compiler,
and on Linux using g++.

The Python version - tested with Python 2.7 (not 3.x) is complete. It prints the box types and sizes, and parses XML and extracts the image files.
